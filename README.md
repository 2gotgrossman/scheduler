# Scheduler 1.0

## The need / story

Self control is hard to come by. Sometimes, there's a lot of things to do and I can't decide what to do / what's the order to do it in. Many times, I spend more time thinking about what I need to do than I spend doing things.

Also, I at times can make a perfect schedule, but then things happen. Something really interesting in the moment comes up (hanging out with friends, a good conversation, etc), but my day does not adapt. I want my schedule to adapt to changes in how I complete my schedule.

## Minimum requirements for the solution

1. User inputs TODO items
2. Scheduler schedules items in calendar
3. If task complete, it is removed (by user or scheduler) from TODOs.
4. If task is incomplete in the time period and user needs a new calendar, user can refresh the calendar.

## Cool features
1. TODO items input into Trello
2. Calendar updated on Google  Calendar
3. Priority of tasks
4. Due dates of tasks
5. Types of tasks

## Big things to implement
1. INPUT EVENT
2. STORE EVENT (can probably be done just with Trello)
3. CREATE DAY
4. COMPLETE EVENT 
5. REFRESH CALENDAR
